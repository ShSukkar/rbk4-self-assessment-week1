## Data Structures
* [ ] Describe the difference between a stack and a queue and give examples of when you might use them.

## Queue vs. Stack
Please write your explanation below.

Stack (LIFO): Last elem In will be the First elem Out
	When we add elements to a stack, the last element inserted will be the first element to be deleted if we apply remove function on the slack.

Example of stack use: the broswer pages navigation.


Queue (FIFO): First element In will be the First element Out
	When we add elements to a queue, the first element inserted will be the first element to be deleted if we apply remove function on the queue.

Example of queue use: the orders which have been sent to a printer.
