## Data Structures
* [ ] Describe the difference between a stack and a queue and give examples of when you might use them.

## Queue vs. Stack
Please write your explanation below.

Stack (LIFO): Last elem In will be the First elem Out
- When we add elements to a stack, the last element inserted will be the first element to be deleted if we apply remove function on the slack.

Example of stack use:
- the broswer pages navigation: during navigating between some websites pages in the same tab, when we click back button, the last page we've visited will be the first page to be removed from the navigated pages.


Queue (FIFO): First element In will be the First element Out
- When we add elements to a queue, the first element inserted will be the first element to be deleted if we apply remove function on the queue.

Example of queue use: 
- the orders which have been sent to a printer: the first page has been sent to a printer in order to print it, it'll be the first printed page.
